# ContactManager
Contact Manager using Angular.js and Firebase ( with AngularFire )


AngularJS is a JavaScript-based front-end web application framework mainly maintained by Google to develope single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures( also defined MVW, Model-View-Whatever), along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML page, which has additional custom tag attributes embedded into it. Angular interprets those attributes as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. 

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service.
Firebase provides a realtime database: it possible to sync data in real time with our application without bothering about the back-end. All we need to do is make some API calls.

Firebase provides also dynamic web hosting service, contact manager url: https://contactmanager-c09ce.firebaseapp.com

AngularFire is the officially supported AngularJS binding for Firebase. The combination of Angular and Firebase provides a three-way data binding between your HTML, your JavaScript, and the Firebase database.
